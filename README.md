Capstone Project Proposal 

What goal will your website be designed to achieve? 

This is an app to help art fair goers plan and organize their visits, save artworks that they like and stay informed of artworks for sale even if they don’t attend the art fair event in person.

What kind of users will visit your site? In other words, what is the demographic of your users? 

Fine art enthusiasts, Interior Designers, Art collectors, Journalists, Art advisors/consultants and other art professionals will use the web app. 

What data do you plan on using? You may have not picked your actual API yet, which is fine, just outline what kind of data you would like it to contain. 

The Artsy API. They have a ‘fairs’ API that lists the ‘shows’.. From the ‘Shows’ API I will be able to query the ‘partner’(gallery) and  ‘arworks’; from the ‘artworks’ API I can query the artist. 

In brief, outline your approach to creating your project (knowing that you may not know everything in advance and that these details might change later).
